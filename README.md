## Rational Sieve

In mathematics, the rational sieve is a general algorithm for factoring integers into prime factors. 

While it is rather useless as a practical factoring algorithm, it is a helpful first step for those trying to understand how the general number field sieve works.

Step 2: 
 Use Gaussian elimination to multiply relations so the exponents of the primes on the right hand side are all even
 This gives us a congruence of squares of the form a2 â‰¡ b2 (mod N), which can be turned into a factorization of N
